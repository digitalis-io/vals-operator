  ## About Vals-Operator

  Here at [Digitalis](https://digitalis.io) we love [vals](https://github.com/helmfile/vals), it's a tool we use daily to keep secrets stored securely. Inspired by this tool,
  we have created an operator to manage Kubernetes secrets.

  *vals-operator* syncs secrets from any secrets store supported by [vals](https://github.com/helmfile/vals) into Kubernetes. Also, `vals-operator` supports database secrets
  as provider by [HashiCorp Vault Secret Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases).
